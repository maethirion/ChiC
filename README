ChiC = The Chicago Construction

This repository consists of MATLAB codes which help generate the current state of the `storage versus repair-bandwidth tradeoff curvesâ€™ for exact-repairable regenerating codes for distributed storage systems.

For details, refer to the following paper(s)

"New Codes and Inner Bounds for Exact Repair in Distributed Storage Systems" authored by S. Goparaju, S. El Rouayheb and R. Calderbank.
